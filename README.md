## Overview

A first-person multiplayer sample project built with **Unity 6** demonstrating how to combine Netcode for GameObjects, Unity Relay, and Vivox proximity voice chat into a complete networked experience for up to 4 players.

Players can walk, sprint, jump, and ground-slam through a shared environment, pick up and throw physics objects, and communicate via 3D positional voice chat — all with server-authoritative networking.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in Unity 6 (`6000.3.5f2`+).
3. Link the project to a Unity Cloud project with Relay and Vivox enabled via **Edit > Project Settings > Services**.
4. Open `Assets/Scenes/Multiplayer.unity` and enter Play mode to host a session, or open `Assets/Scenes/Singleplayer.unity` for solo play.

## Features

- **First-person movement** — walk, sprint, jump (with coyote time and jump buffering), air control, and ground slam
- **Networked item interaction** — pick up, hold, rotate, and throw physics objects with server-authoritative positioning
- **Lobby and Relay flow** — host or join sessions through Unity Relay with a clean lobby UI; supports up to 4 players
- **Proximity voice chat** — 3D positional audio via Vivox with a visible speaking indicator
- **Player differentiation** — unique head colours assigned per player (Blue, Pink, Green, Yellow)
- **Singleplayer mode** — a standalone scene for exploring mechanics without networking
- **Connection approval** — server-side player cap and designated spawn points
